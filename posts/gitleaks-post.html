            <h1>Gitleaks Pre-Commit Hook</h1>
            
            <p>So last week I almost pushed an API key to a public repo. Caught it just in time, but it got me thinking — I really need to automate this check.</p>
            
            <p>Found Gitleaks, which is great, but setting it up as a global pre-commit hook was more steps than I wanted to remember. So I wrote a script that does it all in one go.</p>
            
            <h2>What it does</h2>
            <p>Basically runs Gitleaks before every commit. If it finds something that looks like a secret (API keys, tokens, passwords, whatever), it blocks the commit. Simple.</p>
            
            <p>One command to install:</p>
            <pre style="background: #21252b; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; overflow-x: auto; border-left: 3px solid #98c379;"><code>curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmedeoV/gitleaks-pre-commit-hook/refs/heads/main/gitleaks-local-git-pre-hook.sh | bash</code></pre>
            
            <p>Then it just works everywhere. All repos, automatically protected.</p>
            
            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>I don't have to think about it. That's the whole point. I code, I commit, if there's something sensitive in there, it stops me. Done.</p>
            
            <p>It detects like 100+ different types of secrets out of the box. You can add custom rules too if you have specific patterns you want to catch.</p>
            
            <h2>One small annoyance</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it flags false positives. But you can bypass with <code style="color: #98c379;">--no-verify</code> when you're sure it's safe. Haven't needed to do that often though.</p>
            
            <p>Already saved me twice from pushing stuff I shouldn't. Feels good knowing it's there watching.</p>
