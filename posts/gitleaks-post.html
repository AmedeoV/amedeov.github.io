            <h1>Gitleaks Pre-Commit Hook</h1>
            
            <p>As a software engineer, sometimes when troubleshooting something I need to hardcode passwords locally to connect to DEV environments. Yeah, I could use environment variables and all that... but let's be honest - when you just want to quickly check something, hardcoding it is the fastest way. I know, I'm lazy.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically, I was trying to verify that a password for connecting to Redis in DEV was correct. After adding it to the code and testing it, I had that sinking feeling about "what if I accidentally commit and push this?" That got me thinking - I really need to automate this check.</p>
            
            <p>Initially I used TruffleHog and wrote a <a href="https://github.com/AmedeoV/trufflehog-pre-commit-hook" target="_blank">pre-commit hook script for it</a>. But after chatting with a few colleagues, they suggested I have a look at Gitleaks instead. The key difference? TruffleHog tries to verify if secrets are actually valid, but that's not what I wanted. Even if something looks like a false positive, I want to be the one who decides that. Gitleaks just flags patterns and lets you deal with it - which is exactly the behavior I needed.</p>
            
            <p>Now, Gitleaks does offer a <a href="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-commit" target="_blank">pre-commit setup in their README</a>, but that involves installing the pre-commit package manager and configuring it per repository. I work with over 100 repos. I need something simple that works globally across all of them, not something I have to set up individually for each project. Yes, I am still lazy..</p>
            
            <p>So I wrote a script that does it all in one go.</p>
            
            <h2>What it does</h2>
            <p>Basically runs Gitleaks before every commit. If it finds something that looks like a secret (API keys, tokens, passwords, whatever), it blocks the commit. Simple.</p>
            
            <p>One command to install:</p>
            <pre style="background: #21252b; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; overflow-x: auto; border-left: 3px solid #98c379;"><code>curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmedeoV/gitleaks-pre-commit-hook/refs/heads/main/gitleaks-local-git-pre-hook.sh | bash</code></pre>
            
            <p>Then it just works everywhere. All repos, automatically protected.</p>
            
            <h2>Why I like it</h2>
            <p>I don't have to think about it. That's the whole point. I code, I commit, if there's something sensitive in there, it stops me. Done.</p>
            
            <p>It detects like 100+ different types of secrets out of the box. You can add custom rules too if you have specific patterns you want to catch.</p>
            
            <h2>One small annoyance</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it flags false positives. But you can bypass with <code style="color: #98c379;">--no-verify</code> when you're sure it's safe. Haven't needed to do that often though.</p>
            
            <p>Already saved me twice from pushing stuff I shouldn't. Feels good knowing it's there watching.</p>
