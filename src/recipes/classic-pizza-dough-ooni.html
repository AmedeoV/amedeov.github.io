<h1>Classic Pizza Dough (Ooni)</h1>

<p><em>Makes 3x 330g dough balls (16-inch pizzas) or 4x 250g balls (12-inch pizzas)</em></p>
<p><strong>Prep time:</strong> 1-2 hours bulk prove + 20 mins final prove</p>

<p>The classic Neapolitan pizza dough from Ooni. Uses "00" flour for that silky, strong dough with good structure and elasticity. Simple ingredients, but the technique matters.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>613g (5¼ cups) "00" flour (use Caputo Blue), plus extra for dusting</li>
    <li>368g (1½ cups + 1 tbsp) water: 245g cold + 123g boiling</li>
    <li>18g (3 tsp) sea salt</li>
    <li>8½g (1 tbsp) fresh yeast, or 3½g (1 heaping tsp) active dry yeast, or 2.7g (1 tsp) instant dried yeast</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare water:</strong> Put 245g cold water in mixing bowl. Boil 123g water in saucepan.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Add yeast and salt:</strong> Dissolve yeast and salt in the warm water mixture.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Mix dough:</strong> By hand: Mix in large bowl, then knead on floured surface for 10 mins </li>
    
    <li><strong>Shape and bulk prove:</strong> Lightly flour work surface. Turn out dough and shape into a nice smooth round ball - don't overwork it, just neaten it up. Place in covered bowl/proving tub. Prove in warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. Ready when soft, shiny, with air bubbles.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Divide and ball:</strong> Flour work surface well. Divide dough into 3 pieces (~330g each for 16-inch pizzas) or 4 pieces (~250g each for 12-inch pizzas). Weigh each piece and adjust if needed. To shape each ball: gently move it round, tucking extra dough underneath while pinching and spinning at the bottom to create a neat ball.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Final prove:</strong> Place balls on lightly floured proving tray, not too close together. Cover with lid or plastic wrap. Prove for 20 minutes. This makes dough super pliable and easier to stretch.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Stretch dough:</strong> Lightly flour pizza peel. Gently scoop up dough ball from underneath, place shiny/soft side down on peel. Push out from middle to edges, leaving nice fat crust on the edge. Pick up dough and do the "steering wheel" - gently turn it around using thumb and forefinger to pull the dough, maintaining that generous thick puffy crust. If middle is too thick, use both hands to slowly pull dough out further. Don't worry if it's not perfectly round - it'll still taste great.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Check before topping:</strong> Make sure pizza base isn't sticking to peel. Give it a little shake. Oven should be preheated to 500°C (932°F) for about 30 minutes. Don't cook Neapolitan pizza below 400°C.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Top pizza:</strong> Don't use too much topping or it becomes difficult to get off the peel. For classic Margherita: San Marzano tomato sauce (not too much - don't want a sloppy pizza), torn fior di latte mozzarella (don't overload), drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, fresh basil sprigs.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Launch and cook:</strong> Slide pizza into oven. Cook for 60-90 seconds, turning every 20 seconds for even bake.</li>
