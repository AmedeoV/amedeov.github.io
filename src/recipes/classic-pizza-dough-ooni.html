<h1>Classic Pizza Dough (Ooni)</h1>

<p><em>Makes 3x 330g dough balls (16-inch pizzas) or 4x 250g balls (12-inch pizzas)</em></p>
<p><strong>Prep time:</strong> 3-4 hours total (includes rising)</p>

<p>The classic Neapolitan pizza dough recipe. Flour, salt, water and yeast - that's it. This one's from Ooni, so it's designed for high-temp ovens, but should work in any pizza oven.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>368g (1½ cups + 1 tbsp) lukewarm water</li>
    <li>3½g (1 heaping tsp) active dry yeast, or 2.7g instant dried yeast, or 8½g fresh yeast</li>
    <li>613g (5¼ cups) "00" flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
    <li>18g (3 tsp) sea salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Dissolve:</strong> In a bowl, add the warm water and yeast. Stir until dissolved.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix:</strong> Combine flour and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually add to the wet ingredients until a dough forms. 
        <ul>
            <li>Stand mixer: Mix on low with dough hook for 5-10 mins until firm, smooth and elastic</li>
            <li>By hand: Stir with wooden spoon, then knead on floured surface for 10 mins</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Cover bowl with dish towel. Let rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide:</strong> Divide into 3 pieces (for 16-inch pizzas) or 4 pieces (for 12-inch pizzas). Roll each into perfect balls. Place each in separate bowl/tray, cover and rise for another 30-60 mins until doubled in size.
        <ul>
            <li>To freeze: Put dough balls in individual bags and freeze at this point</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Stretch:</strong> Place dough ball on lightly floured surface. Use fingertips to press into small flat disc, working from center outward. Pick up and gently stretch all around the edge, letting gravity pull it into a circle. Should be thin enough to see through when held up to light.</li>
    <li><strong>Place on peel:</strong> Flour pizza peel and lay stretched base on it. Pinch any small holes back together. Add toppings only when oven is hot.</li>
    <li><strong>Launch:</strong> Slide pizza into hot oven. Cook 1-2 minutes, turning every 20 seconds for even bake.</li>
    <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Remove with clean peel. Slice and serve.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This is the hand-mixing method. If using a spiral mixer, there's a different recipe optimized for that.</p>
<p>Neapolitan-style bases are very thin - you should be able to see through them.</p>
